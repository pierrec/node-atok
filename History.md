0.2.3 / 2012-03-16
==================

  * Added [pipe], [listening], [open] and [close] events to the event set
  * Added support for array of functions in rule definitions: addRule([fn1, fn2...], ...)
  * Fixed wrong array size in sliceArguments()
  * Fix: `firstOf` now honors `escaped()`
  * Fix: invalid rule index after when using `loadRuleSet()` or `next()`
  * Code refactoring
    * automatic masked Rule#test() method
    * `escaped()` subrules

0.2.2 / 2012-02-29
==================

  * Fixed rule set name not being reset upon `clearRule()`
  * Fixed `clearProps()` not chainable
  * Added `break()`: abort a current rule set. Use continue(-1) to resume at the current subrule.
  * Added `version` property

0.2.1 / 2012-02-26
==================

  * Multiple calls to `debug()` fix

0.2.0 / 2012-02-24
==================

  * `split()` removed as it can be achieved with current rules definition and adds little value
  * Performance improvements (~50% compared to v0.1.10)
    * [match] event removed as redundant with the [debug] event
    * [loadruleset] and [seek] events moved under the [debug] event
  * [debug] event signature: (method name, type, data)
  * `debug` option moved to the `debug()` method so debug mode can be turned on and off dynamically
  * Added `events` property to Atok

0.1.10 / 2012-02-23
===================

  * Code cleanups
  * Performance improvements
    * Moved from node's EventEmitter to [ev](https://github.com/pierrec/node-ev)
      * (+) faster by about 20%
      * (-) leverages ev's emit shortcuts
    * `Rule.test()` dynamically set based on rule's static conditions:
      * (+) faster by about 10%
      * (-) much larger code generated by [ekam](https://github.com/pierrec/node-ekam)
  * Added benchmarks for every subrule type
  * New `split(flag)` property: split token by subrules. No effect if # of subrules is < 3.
  * New `debug` option: emits the [debug] event if set to true or trigger the given function for debugging purposes. Note that thanks to dynamic method setting, this has absolutely no impact on performance if not set!

0.1.9 / 2012-02-20
==================

  * `continue()` supports string and function input - __must__ perform a `saveRuleSet()` to take effect
  * Some refactoring
    * Array.prototype.slice calls
    * Rule index internal fetching

0.1.8 / 2012-02-12
==================

  * `clearProps()` reset properties to their default values
  * `saveProps()` -> `saveProps(name)` with name=default if not set

0.1.7 / 2012-02-12
==================

  * `addRule(rule, 123)` fixed when used with `quiet(true)`
  * `continue()` applied when a handler uses `pause()`
  * `write()` will continue at the last rule index if the last successful rule was subject to `continue()`
  * `next()` and `ignore()` can now be applied to `addRule(0)` - note that `continue()` cannot
  * [loadruleset] and [seek] events

0.1.6 / 2012-02-09
==================
  * `addRule(123)` now honors `quiet()`

0.1.5 / 2012-02-09
==================

  * new property: Atok.ending (Boolean): indicates if `end()` was called
  * new events:
    * match (replaces matchEventHandler): rule match (current offset, matched size, matched rule object)
    * empty: empty buffer (ending flag)
    cf. TODO about the performance impact when listeners are attached
  * `addRule([rules], 0)` fixed
  * `addRule('', handler)` now honors `quiet()`
  * handlers triggered in `quiet()` mode gives the non extracted token size as the first argument (actually introduced in the previous release)
  * emptyHandler now triggered on a per rule set basis

0.1.4 / 2012-02-06
==================

  * New matchEventHandler property (Function): triggered upon a rule match with
    arguments: <offset>, <matched length>, <rule object>
  * `continue()` accepts negative input
  * `addRule(-1, handler)` triggers [handler] when tokenizer has ended

0.1.3 / 2012-02-05
==================

  * When `quiet()`, the token is set to the would be token length
  * `seek()` decreases bytes on negative seek
  * Added `existsRule()`
  * Added `deleteRuleSet()`
  * Added `getRuleSet()`
  * Added `getAllRuleSet()`

0.1.2 / 2012-02-03
==================

  * Changed `length()` to be a property
  * Added `addRuleFirst()`
  * Added `continue()`
  * If any remaining data, `end()` signature set to (token, -1, ruleSetName)
  * `setEncoding()` default value is UTF-8, utf-8 and utf8 are also accepted
  * `removeRule()` fixed processing Function

0.1.1 / 2012-01-31
==================

  * Fixed utf8 handling in `write()`
  * Fixed return flag in `write()`, resolving `pipe()` freeze

0.1.0 / 2012-01-30
==================

  * First release
